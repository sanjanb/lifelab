## About Prompts

Prompts are completely optional thinking starters:

- "What did I notice this week?"
- "What feels unclear right now?"
- "What pattern am I seeing?"
- "What am I avoiding?"
- "What assumption am I making?"

**You can:**

- Ignore them completely
- Dismiss them while writing
- Use them as inspiration
- Create your own (future feature)

**Prompts never:**

- Appear automatically
- Require an answer
- Judge your writing

---

## Philosophy

This is **thinking space**, not a performance tool.

**What you WON'T find here:**

- No word counts
- No writing streaks
- No emotional analysis
- No "insights" about your writing
- No reminders to write
- No pressure to be consistent

**What IS allowed:**

- Writing whenever you want
- Empty weeks
- Unfinished thoughts
- Complete silence
- Just thinking

---

## Technical Details

**Storage:**

- Saves locally first (works offline)
- Syncs to Firebase when available (if configured)
- No sync status shown (it just works)

**Privacy:**

- Completely private
- No sharing features
- No external access
- Your thoughts are yours alone

---

## Design Intentions

**The editor:**

- Uses a serif font (Georgia) for comfortable reading
- Has generous line height (1.8) for clarity
- No formatting tools to distract
- Feels like writing in a notebook

**The save button:**

- Explicit, not automatic
- Gives you control over when thoughts are "complete"
- Shows brief "Saved" confirmation
- No anxiety-inducing sync indicators

**The reading view:**

- Wide margins for focus
- Clean typography
- No metrics or metadata clutter
- Just you and your past thoughts

---

## What Makes This Different

Unlike journaling apps that track mood, count words, or analyze sentiment...

**This feature gets out of the way.**

If you forget the tool exists while writing, we succeeded.

If you're thinking about features or performance, something went wrong.

## Common Questions

**Q: How often should I write?**  
A: Whenever you want. Never out of obligation.

**Q: Should I use prompts?**  
A: Only if they're helpful. Ignore them if not.

**Q: What if I don't write for weeks?**  
A: That's completely fine. Silence is allowed.

**Q: Can I delete all my reflections?**  
A: Yes, with confirmation for each one.

**Q: Will this analyze my writing?**  
A: No. Never. That would violate the core philosophy.

**Q: Can I export my reflections?**  
A: Future feature, but yes—your data is yours.

## Protected Philosophy

This feature will **never** have:

- Sentiment analysis
- Writing streaks
- Performance metrics
- AI summaries
- Gamification
- Social features
- Forced structure
- Automatic prompts

_See `docs/REFLECTION_NON_GOALS.md` for the complete list._

## If Something Feels Wrong

The Reflection Journal should feel:

- **Calm** (not urgent)
- **Private** (not observed)
- **Optional** (not required)
- **Timeless** (not dated)
- **Thoughtful** (not productive)

If it doesn't feel this way, that's a bug worth reporting.

_Your first thought awaits._
