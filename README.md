## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Modular Design**: Each domain is a self-contained module
- **Universal Entry Model**: All entries share the same data structure
- **Configuration-Driven**: Easy to add new domains via `config.js`
- **Storage Abstraction**: Centralized localStorage management

### Data Model

Each entry follows this structure:

```javascript
{
  id: "unique-identifier",
  timestamp: 1704326400000,
  value: "What you tracked",
  notes: "Optional notes"
}
```

### Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers that support:

- ES6 JavaScript
- localStorage API
- CSS Grid and Flexbox

## Privacy & Data

- **100% Local**: All data stored in browser localStorage
- **No Tracking**: No analytics, no external requests
- **Export/Import**: Not yet implemented (coming soon)
- **Data Persistence**: Data persists until you clear browser data

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future development:

- Data export/import functionality
- Charts and visualizations
- Goal setting and progress tracking
- Custom domain creation
- Dark mode
- Mobile-responsive improvements
